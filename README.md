# Javascript 30

I wanted to start learning TypeScript, but kept coming across articles and tidbits of advice saying that knowing the fundamentals of JavaScript is, well, _fundamental_ before moving on to frameworks or supersets.

I decided to take up the [JavaScript 30](https://javascript30.com/) challenge not only to brush up on what I learned during my bootcamp, but also to get into the habit of coding (almost) every day.

The goal is to complete one tutorial per day, Monday - Friday.
